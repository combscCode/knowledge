## KNOWLEDGE

if you're like me, you like [knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QngdmlE2-Mk)!

this folder is for helping us all improve our workflows at work. I'm sick of wasting time wrestling with programs bc I didn't read the documentation. The goal is for only 1 person to read documentation and then they can tell all the homies how to do things properly so we waste as little time as possible.

Really anything can go in here, but the focus is on bash/linux stuff. This type of stuff really applies as long as you're working on a computer it's pretty dope. But feel free to add whatever you want!

REMEMBER! If you look for something in here and you find something unhelpful, fix it!!! This helps YOU in the future and OTHERS who are using this as a resource :) Help the saline squad out you know?
